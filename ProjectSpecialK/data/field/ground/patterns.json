	Okay so first of all, look at your numpad. If you don't have one:
	  / * -
	7 8 9 +
	4 5 6
	1 2 3 =
	0   .
	We'll focus on the middle bit, the numbers 1 to 9.
	Notice that there's also arrows and home/end/pgup/pgdn in there:
	home ↑ pgup
	   ← . →
	 end ↓ pgdn
	So you can see why NumLock would toggle between entering numbers
	and pretending to be those eight keys.
	
	Second, an assumption about rotations: the models for cliffs,
	assuming no rotation, have the "left" wall facing to the left.
	So if you extract the Cliff-5B model and don't apply any further
	rotation, it will have a wall segment on the left edge of the tile.
	Therefore, we'll notate this as "147". Cliff-3C is a corner piece
	with a left edge and a top edge, so that's "14789". Now, rotating
	Cliff-5B or "147" once by 90° turns it such that the one edge is
	along the bottom, so it's effectively "123".
	
	We can now match patterns to models.
